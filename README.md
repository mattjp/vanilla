## What you (Chris) will need:
- [Python 3.6.x](https://www.python.org/)
  - A bunch of Python plugins, but I forgot which ones I had to install, so I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it
- [Flask 0.12.2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask/0.12.2#downloads)
- [Terminal](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/)
- [Text editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- [SQLite](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_installation.htm)
- A positive attitude
